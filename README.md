# rsudoku

## Purpose

This is a recreation of a project I did for university to solve sudoku's.
That was done in Python, and I've uploaded
[here](https://github.com/VoltRadar/python-sudoku-solver).
I made this project in part to get experience with Rust, and to compare to
Python, with attention paid to performance, development time, and ease of
use

## Solving strategy's

The methods I used to solve each were very similar I'll outline them here

### Structure

// Uhhh something about how I'm storing and loading the boards I think, then a despription of initalisation, narrowing, (investiation of if narrowing multiplue times is needed), then random guessing
